**This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) for cancer detection.**

**Project Goals:**

Develop a deep learning model for cancer detection using medical images and potentially patient medical history data.
Improve diagnostic accuracy and enable earlier cancer detection.
Reduce reliance on traditional methods and potentially pave the way for personalized medicine.

**Completed Work:**

This project successfully implements a deep learning model for cancer detection using CNNs and potentially LSTMs. The core implementation resides in the provided Jupyter Notebooks within the repository. 

**The notebooks cover the following aspects:**

Data preprocessing for medical images (potentially including text data if applicable).
Development of the deep learning model architecture.
Training of the model on the provided datasets.
Evaluation of the model's performance on a separate testing dataset.

**Dataset:**

The project utilized datasets from the following sources:
Medical Text Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/falgunipatel19/biomedical-text-publication-classification

**Future Considerations:**

Further refinement of the model architecture and hyperparameters for potentially improved performance.
Integration of the model into a production environment for real-world testing (if applicable).
Exploration of additional data sources for potentially enhanced accuracy.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sudarsansathishkumar/CancerDetection`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Refer to the Jupyter Notebooks for a detailed explanation of the project's implementation.
